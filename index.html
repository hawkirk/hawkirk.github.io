  <h2>About</h2>
  
  Hello! My name is <b>harrison kirk</b>.

  <p>

    I’m a data analyst with experience in the public and nonprofit sectors, and I currently work at <a href="https://www.edanalytics.org/">Education Analytics</a> on the analytics team. My goal is to use data to develop policy solutions for issues regarding equity in public health and education.

  </p>

  <p>

    I’m a skilled programmer with a preference for R, but I’ve also worked with SQL, Python, and SAS. My skills include data manipulation and cleaning, web scraping, data visualization, dashboarding, and statistical modeling. I also like playing around with web development and design tools, Linux, and experimenting with new technologies along the way.

  </p>

  <p>

    I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor's in political science with a minor in statistics from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Outside of class, I was a data journalist for <a href="https://mustangnews.net/byline/harrison-kirk/">Mustang News</a>, an editor for <a href="https://politicalscience.calpoly.edu/paideia">Paideia</a>, and a volunteer field researcher at <a href="https://slobangers.com/">SLO Bangers Syringe Exchange and Overdose Prevention Program</a>. I also co-wrote and lobbied for a <a href="https://politicalscience.calpoly.edu/pols-440-students-present-sb-467-state-legislature">California Senate Bill</a> that became a law in 2021. Together, these experiences seeded my passion for data-driven policy research.

  </p>

  <p>

    When I’m not working, I love exploring nature, creative writing, travel, shooting film photography, and producing music. I’m an avid fan of hip hop - my top five all-time list is Kendrick Lamar, André 3000, Nas, Lil Wayne, and Yasiin Be (fka Mos Def).

  </p>

  <p>

    This website is very much a work in progress at the moment, but I’m hopeful one day this can be a place to showcase my professional and creative projects.
