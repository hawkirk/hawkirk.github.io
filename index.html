          I’m a data analyst with experience in the public and nonprofit sectors, and I currently work at <a href="https://www.edanalytics.org/">Education Analytics</a> on the analytics team. My goal is to use data to develop policy solutions for issues regarding equity in public health and education.

          I’m a skilled programmer with a preference for R, but I’ve also worked with Python, SAS, and SQL. My skills include data manipulation and cleaning, web scraping, data visualization, dashboarding, and statistical modeling. I also like playing around with web development and design tools, Linux, and experimenting with new technologies along the way.

          I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor's in political science with a minor in statistics from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Outside of class, I was a data analyst intern for the <a href="https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Health-Agency/Behavioral-Health.aspx">San Luis Obispo County Behavioral Health Department</a>, a data journalist for <a href="https://mustangnews.net/byline/harrison-kirk/"><i>Mustang News</i></a>, an editor for <a href="https://politicalscience.calpoly.edu/paideia"><i>Paideia</i></a>, and a volunteer field researcher at <a href="https://slobangers.com/">SLO Bangers Syringe Exchange and Overdose Prevention Program</a>. I also co-wrote and lobbied for a <a href="https://politicalscience.calpoly.edu/pols-440-students-present-sb-467-state-legislature">California Senate Bill</a> that became a law in 2021. Together, these experiences seeded my passion for data-driven policy research.

          When I’m not working, I love exploring nature, creative writing, travel, shooting film photography, and producing music. I’m an avid fan of hip hop - my top five all-time list is Kendrick Lamar, André 3000, Nas, Lil Wayne, and Yasiin Be.
